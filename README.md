# Business Site

A business site to practice responsive videos, accordion (javascript) and forms.

## The problem

I had a great plan for my site to begin with and I am happy how I solved the 3 main tasks for the project. In the end I realised I had'nt thought about mobile first. I tried to fix it, because the overlay text does not look ok in mobile, but since that wasn'nt really part of the criterias I did'nt put more effort to it. I also put width to the accordion and the form which I know it is not good for the responiveness but I could'nt solve it in another way.
